# Be a Film student


![the pits](https://twoevilactors.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/despair.jpg "Pit of Despair")

A few students (the “Clients”) are sitting in class one day, and one of them, Chris, says, “You know, usually there’s nothing better than listening to Bobby, Jason and Sergey teach us JavaScript, but today, they’re kinda dragging.” Ramzi nods and responds, "Yeah, I'm totes in that pit of despair. It's a pity." No one laughs. Then another student, Salwa suggests (as she naturally would), "I know! We need to try film school." James thinks about it for a sec and is like, "Dude, I live in the village; I should be a movie star." Chris responds by saying, "Yeah, and I know that there are a couple film screenings going on in the area. We need to see them in action and learn how to do this ourselves!"

At this point, Ramzi's attention is captured. He knows how to create a company, so he steals Chris's idea and creates "Ramzi's school of expressionist cinematography." Salwa is certain that people would immediately recognize her design sensibilities, so she dramatically exclaims (as she naturally would), "Ramzi, your idea is brilliant!", but because this is now expressionism, there's no sound, so subtitles appear, instead. Chris frustrated chases after Ramzi for stealing his idea, and Salwa carries black and white boards that describe Chris's emotions.

Despite all this, James just shrugs and says, "Whatevs. You guys have no idea what being a celebrity is about. You better start taking these classes, but first let's see how other students and professionals have done this.“

They all stand up, cameras in hand, ready to embark on their new quest but just stand there motionless. They don’t know how to investigate where films have been shot before. They need a website!

It turns out that there’s an NYC database that indicates where and when shooting permits have been acquired, and that can provide the basis for a website that would assist these users.

**User Stories**

* As users, the Clients want to be able to load the page and see a map of New York with icons displaying where shooting permits have been acquired in the past.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to hover over the icons to get a modal window with more details regarding the permits, including the start and end dates, where parking was held and whether the permit was for film, television, commercial or student.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to enter a zip code into a search bar at the top of the page and submit a search which causes the map to zoom in on the selected area, allowing for a greater focus on events in that vicinity.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to login to both record and see a history of the shooting sites they’ve visited. To record which sites they’ve visited, they would like to click a “been there” button in the modal for shooting sites that they’ve visited. Those sites would then be populated in a collapsible sidebar that displays the history of sites that logged in users have visited.
* As users, the Clients want there to be some browser responsiveness
* As users, the Clients want to see a footer that indicates the site was built with love by students of General Assembly and Ramzi's school of expressionist cinematography.

The requirements for the MVP are listed above in the user stories. The site will be built using React, Express, NYC Open Data’s and Google Maps’ APIs. A stateful container will be created around google maps and contain google maps in a react component.
